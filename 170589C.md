# Blockchain Concepts
### Smart Contracts
Smart contracts are code stored on a blockchain. They run when predetermined conditions are met. 
They are used to automate an agreement/ businesses logic so that participants can be immediately certain of the outcome. 
Smart contract eliminate the need for an intermediary. 

### Ledger 
Blockchain is a shared, immutable ledger that records transactions and tracking assets in a network. 
Similar to a database, but not controlled by a central authority. A ledger is distributed across multiple computers.
They can be located all over the world and the validity can be confirmed by anyone who has access to it.
Once the data is added to the ledger, it cannot be removed or edited like with a database (immutability).
